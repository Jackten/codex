# TUI bottom pane (state machines)

When changing the paste-burst or chat-composer state machines in this folder, keep the docs in sync:

- Update the relevant module docs (`chat_composer.rs` and/or `paste_burst.rs`) so they remain a
  readable, top-down explanation of the current behavior.
- Keep implementations/docstrings aligned unless a divergence is intentional and documented.

Practical check:

- After edits, sanity-check that docs mention only APIs/behavior that exist in code (especially the
  Enter/newline paths and `disable_paste_burst` semantics).

## Human-Facing Reports Rule

- Any report, research brief, audit, comparison, decision packet, itinerary, or source-backed deliverable intended for Jack or another human to read must be delivered as polished HTML or PDF. Do not deliver human-facing reports as raw Markdown.
- Markdown is allowed only for agent-internal notes, scratch files, source sidecars, wiki pages, code docs, or when Jack explicitly asks for Markdown.
- Human-facing HTML/PDF reports must include a readable layout, working clickable links, citations/source ledger where sources matter, and clear artifact paths or file delivery in the final response.
- If a research harness or agent workflow produces Markdown first, render it to HTML and/or PDF before presenting it as the human deliverable.
